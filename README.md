# circle-in-a-linked-list

This Python program visualizes Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm) using Pygame.
It simulates a linked list and uses two pointers (slow and fast) to detect a cycle in the list.
The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. If the two pointers meet, it confirms the presence of a cycle.
